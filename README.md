# QF604

This repository is a record of my assignment during my Master of Quantitative Finance studies at Singapore Management University (SMU).

It is a duplicated project based on the article titled 'Climate Risk and Chinese Stock Volatility Forecasting: Evidence from the ESG Index,' published in Finance Research Letters, Volume 55, Part A, July 2023, Article 103898.

The model we are using is the GARCH-MIDAS model, with a rolling window approach to predict volatility. As an extension of this project, we applied Machine Learning Ensemble Methods, specifically Extra Trees Regressor (ETR), AdaBoost Regressor (ABR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR).
